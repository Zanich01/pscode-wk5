// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum


ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

num1 & num2
num1 + num2 
sum = num3
print sum


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Start
2. Input the number to be checked
3. If the number % 2 equals 0, then
4.    Display "The number is even"
5. Else
6.    Display "The number is odd"
7. End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. print [7, 18, 25, 33, 40] 
 
2. // Initialize variables
   sum = 0 
   count = 0
   
   // Input numbers
   numbers = [7, 18, 25, 33, 40]
   
   // Calculate sum of numbers
   for each number in numbers:
   	sum = sum + number
	count = count + 1
    
    // Calculate average
    average = sum / count

    // Return average 
    return average
    print average

3. smallest num7 & largest num40

4. Line 1 = 5 seperate variables
	Line 2 = prints average number from line 1
		Line 3 = the smallest number in line 1 and the largest number in line 1
